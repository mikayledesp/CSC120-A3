Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
I talked to both Lucy and Rebb during TA Hours 

- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
I went to the 2/13 Office hours 

- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
I think after some practice that Java actually makes a lot of sense! I just think it has been taking a lot of work (i.e looking at examples, watching youtube videos) outside of class to undertand the logical coding factors.

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
My conclusion would be that the code is actually pretty similar! For the parsing of each letter to check for the trigger words I actually refrenced a old python homework from 110 where we parsed through inputs in a similar for loop fashion. When first staring out in 120 I though that the code was going to be extremely different but I was pleased to find that many of the foundational concepts we learned are still there. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future? 
I think a little more guidance would help and since it took me a really long time to actually figure out where to start.
